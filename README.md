# Advent of Code 2024 🎄✨

Welcome to my **Advent of Code 2024** repository! This is where I'll be solving the daily coding challenges from [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2024), purely for fun and to give my brain something to think about. 🎅🤓

In this repository:
- 🖥️ All solutions are implemented using **plain JavaScript** (no frameworks, no libraries, just raw JS).
- 📜 Each challenge is in its own file, organized by day.

## Why JavaScript?
'Cause it's cozy szn and I'm comfortable with JS... I swear next time I will try out a different programming language.

## Running the Solutions
1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/rekodev/advent-of-code-2024.git
```
2. Navigate to a day's folder:
```
cd day1
```
3. Run the solution with Node.js:
```
node day1.js
```
